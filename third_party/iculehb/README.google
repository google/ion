This is a version of ICU 54.1 's 'layoutex' subproject that builds against
iculehb instead of ICU's deprecated 'layout' subproject. The original version of
ICU layoutex remains in the ICU tree.  It is there for backwards compatibility.
ICU has no external dependencies and does not want to add a dependency on
iculehb.

This is modified from the original ICU version in the following ways:
- it uses the 'iculx' namespace instead of the 'icu' namespace
- imports use iculehb's headers instead of layout's headers
