The iossim binary here is a build of a tool found in the Chromium project:
  https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/testing/iossim/

It is used to run unit tests for iOS. The old way that directly ran the
executables with some environment variables set no longer works, so this
provides a way that more closely imitates how Xcode itself invokes the
Simulator.
