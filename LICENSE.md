### 5. Submission of Contributions

Unless [**You**](#you) explicitly state otherwise, any [**Contribution**](#contribution) intentionally submitted for inclusion in the [**Work**](#work) by [**You**](#you) to the [**Licensor**](#licensor) shall be under the terms and conditions of this [**License**](#license), without any additional terms or conditions.

### 6. Trademarks

This [**License**](#license) does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the [**Licensor**](#licensor), except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the [**Work**](#work) and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

### 7. Disclaimer of Warranty

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, [**Licensor**](#licensor) provides the [**Work**](#work) (and each [**Contributor**](#contributor) provides its Contributions) on an **`AS IS`** BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

However, in accepting such obligations, [**You**](#you) may act only on [**Your**](#you) own behalf and on [**Your**](#you) sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other [**Contributor**](#contributor), and only if [**You**](#you) agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each [**Contributor**](#contributor) harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such [**Contributor**](#contributor) by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
